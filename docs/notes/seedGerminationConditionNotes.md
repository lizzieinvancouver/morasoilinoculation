This document outlines the steps that will be taken to ensure a smooth set up of the experiment, including all details related to the soil, the conditions in the growth chambers, and the seeds themselves

**Soil**  
Check results of initial agar plates, if clean:

- Run full autoclave batch of soil to be used in experiment   
- Store all autoclaved soil in separate labeled bags

**Pots**

- Place a couple pots in the autoclave when sterilizing soil to see if they melt (they shouldn’t)  
- If they don’t melt, will run a batch of just pots to sterilize them rather than using alcohol

**Chamber conditions**

- Sterilized with UV light prior to placing growth trays inside  
- One chamber for each seed species (2 chambers total)  
- Temperature at 30º celsius for the first 3 days, followed by 25º celsius for the rest of the germination period   
  - This temperature works well for both PSME and TSHE (Bientjes 1954\)

PSME

- Higher intensity light will promote faster and more complete germination

TSHE

- Darkness (for the first 40 days at least) will promote faster and more complete germination

**Seeds**  
**Cleaning**

- Use bleach instead of hydrogen peroxide since the latter can alter/promote germination in seeds  
- Recommended sodium hypochlorite concentration of 1-5% for 2-10 minutes   
- Should be done prior to stratification, if we do stratify  
- Follow methods in Wenny and Dumroese 1987:  
  - 5% sodium hypochlorite (about 2:3 bleach:water)  
  - 10 minute soak with constant agitation  
    - Different bleach for different seed species  
  - Followed by 10 minute soak in tap water to rinse bleach off  
  - Followed again by a 48 hour rinse in running tap water before stratification
