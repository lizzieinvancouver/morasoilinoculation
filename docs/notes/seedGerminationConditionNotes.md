**Inoculation ratios**

**Vanderputten 1988:**

- Used ratios of 1%, 15%, and 50% based on air dry weight

**Ma et al. 2018:**

- 10% inoculation ratio achieved by mixing and homogenizing soil prior to filling pots  
  - Could allow for simplified potting procedure and more even/homogenized representation of biological community  
- Filled pots based on air dry weight of soil (not volume)

**Stratification and Germination Requirements**

**Bientjes 1954:**   
For both western hemlock and douglas fir, longer stratification periods were shown to decrease the minimum temperature required for germination (pdf page 39\)

For western hemlock (pdf page 108):

- Final germination percentage is not influenced by the length of the stratification period  
- Germination rate however, is influenced by the length of the stratification period, with longer stratification producing faster germination  
- For both final germination percentage and germination rate, the best results were obtained by a 20º germination temperature  
  - Alternating between 25º and 20º produces a higher final germination percentage than 25º, but the reverse is true for germination rate

For Douglas fir (pdf page 39):

- After one week of stratification, the best germination was achieved with 3 days at 30º followed by 25º for the rest of the period  
  - Second best germination was obtained at 25º and the poorest at 20º  
- After 6 weeks of stratification, the seeds showed an indifference to germination temperature, with all germination temperatures producing nearly identical germination curves

**Edwards 1973 (western hemlock):** 

- Stratification periods of any length reduced the time it took for seeds to germinate (increased germination rate)  
  - On average, stratification reduced the number of days it took to reach 50% germination by approximately 5  
- Stratification had little to no effect on the germination capacity, or percent germination achieved after 28 days  
- One week of stratification produced the biggest increase in the germination rate  
- Seeds were germinated at the optimum germination temperature for TSHE of 20º ± 0.5º  
- 8 hour photoperiod was used 

**Allen 1941a:**

- A temperature of 20.5º was used to germinate douglas fir seed  
  - Cited in many other papers as the ideal germination conditions

**Allen 1941b:**

- Showed that Douglas Fir and Western Hemlock show higher indifference to germination temperature when seeds have been stratified   
- Non-stratified seed (for PSME) germinated better at higher temperatures (25-30)  
  - More specifically, first 3 days at 30 degrees followed by 25 degrees for the rest of the period  
- For the first 30 days, hemlock prefers darkness, but has no preference after 40 days  
- Stratification reduces the sensitivity of seeds to light, effectively eliminating it as a factor in germination  
  - For PSME (favours light), this means higher light levels has no effect on germination rate, compared to increasing germination rate in unstratified seeds  
  - For TSHE (favours dark), this means darkness has no effect on germination rate, compared to increasing germination rate in unstratified seeds

**Edwards and Olsen 1973 (western hemlock):**

- Germination rate was fastest for both stratified and unstratified seeds under 4 hour photoperiods (4 hours of light per day)  
- Stratification increased germination rate for all seedlots under all photoperiods compared to unstratified seeds

**Johnson and Irgens-Moller 1964 (douglas fir):**

- 2 photoperiod treatments of either 9 hours (8AM to 5PM) or 7 and 2 hours (8AM to 3PM and 11PM to 1AM)  
- 2 temperature treatments of either 19º at all times, or 25º from 8AM to 5PM and 19º from 5PM to 8AM  
- Total germination after 32 days was significantly higher for the alternating temperature treatments, but only 2% lower for the 9 hour photoperiod compared to the 7+2 hour photoperiod  
- Germination was much lower for the 19º temperature treatments, but was 18% higher for the split 7+2 hour photoperiod treatment
