**MORA**

Tsuga *heterophylla*: western Hemlock

- 100+ seeds available from [treeseeds.ca](http://treeseeds.ca) for $12   
- 90 days cold stratification ([treeseeds.ca](http://treeseeds.ca))  
- 3-4 weeks at 1-4 degrees (US Forest Service)  
- 3-4 weeks at 1-4 degrees (UW)  
- Sow 1-2 cm deep in soil  
- Typically around 50% germination success, should order double or more the number of seeds required by the number of replicates

Thuja *plicata*: western red cedar

- 100+ seeds available from [treeseeds.ca](http://treeseeds.ca) for $9  
- 30 days cold stratification ([treeseeds.ca](http://treeseeds.ca))  
- May germinate well without stratification (USFS)  
- No stratification necessary (UW)  
- Sow on soil surface  
- Seed mortality is very high, likely want many more seeds than needed by the exact number of replicates

Pseudotsuga *menziensii:* douglas fir

- 50 seeds available from [treeseeds.ca](http://treeseeds.ca) for $8  
- No stratification necessary   
- Longer stratification resulted in greater germination odds, with 25 degrees incubation temperature showing the highest germination (Allen 1960\)   
- 28-45 days at 3 degrees is typical and effective stratification practice (UW)  
- 1-2 weeks in well watered substrate for germination  
- Germination rate between 70 and 90 % in controlled stratification conditions, double the number of replicates should be enough seeds

Seeds can also be purchased from the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development through the Seed Planning and Registry (SPAR) with an account and a BCeID (which I do not have). 

Based on USFS stratification recommendations, only TSHE may need cold stratification, and PSME would benefit from warm stratification. The included information from the University of Washington seems to corroborate that from USFS. 

**Swiss**

- 19 seeds available for $8 USD (https://sheffields.com/seeds/Fagus/sylvatica)  
- 90 days cold germination (or longer for better germination odds)  
- Sow 1 cm deep in soil

- 21 seeds available for $5 USD ([https://sheffields.com/seeds/Acer/campestre](https://sheffields.com/seeds/Acer/campestre))  
- 30 day warm stratification followed by 120 days cold stratification
