Soil Inoculation Pilot

## Study Plans and Protocols

**In the field \- August 11-15**

* At each of the 10 sites at MORA:  
  * Record approximate forest composition, including dominant species in canopy and canopy cover  
  * Take notes on forest floor cover, including any cones found, germinants, and litter  
  * Take soil samples from adjacent to seed traps at locations both near and far from adult conspecific tree according to the protocol below  
* For each soil sample collected:  
  * Using a soil corer if available (or a spade if not), dig out a soil sample from a depth of 5 cm with a diameter of 2.5cm (or up to 15 cm according to Coughlin) retaining litter as well as lower soil levels  
  * Soil corer or spade should be sterilized after each soil collection  
    * Can be done with a spray bottle of rubbing alcohol and a cloth  
  * Wear new gloves at each soil sample collected  
  * Store soil sample in plastic bags, use a sharpie to label each sample’s site, distance from conspecific, and tree species  
  * While in the field, store soil samples in cooler bag  
  * When we arrive at electric cooler, store all plastic bags in the cooler near 4 C (but do not freeze)   
  * Immediately upon returning from the field, store soil samples in cold room provided in forestry (Nolan was trained on this)

Things to bring:

- Notebook (and pencil/pen)  
- Soil corer/spade  
- Alcohol spray   
- 20 (minimium) plastic ziploc bags, pre-labeled if possible  
- Sharpie to label bags as we go  
- Cooler for just soil  
- Data sheet if there is sufficient data to collect (soil layers, tree cover, …)
- Gloves ($22 for 100 ct at Shoppers)

- Total cost: $30

**Lab protocol: experiment set-up \- August 16-23 (10-20 hours)**

* Sterilize seeds with a laundry bleach solution containing 2 parts bleach to 3 parts water (Wenny and Dumroese 1987\)
  * No notes in Lipson about bleach concentration, James 1987 (and other papers) suggests using 40% bleach to 60% distilled water
  * Soak in bleach solution for 10 minutes with constant agitation  
    * Discard bleach solution after a single use  
  * Soak in water with constant agitation for 5 minutes to rinse off bleach to prevent damage to seeds  
  * Wenny 1987 suggests rinsing in running tap water for 2 days continuous to ensure all bleach is removed (may not be necessary)  
* Hydrogen peroxide or tetrazolium tests can estimate viability in about 7 days
  * Viability tests should be performed on around 100 seeds (could manually check inside 50 seeds and do viability tests on another 50 after that)
  * Details on how to do this in Leadem 1984  
  * Hydrogen peroxide is good for douglas fir but less ideal for western hemlock due to its small seed size  
  * Tetrazolium test can be used for western hemlock if we have it available  
    * Tetrazolium is much more expensive  
* Use autoclave to sterilize both field soil and matrix potting soil   
  * 25L bags of soil available at canadian tire for only a few $$, which would we need?   
    * Could also get in touch with Dan at the field to see what he suggests  
  * Autoclave time slot will need to be booked (Nolan can take care of this, will decide on dates and times soon)  
  * It should be possible to autoclave most of the soil in one go (2 hours maximum), but two timeslots should be booked in case agar plates show microbial growth  
  * After autoclaving, perform microbial assays using agar plates  
    * Perform two microbial platings for each of the 3 levels in the autoclave (6 plates per autoclave session)
    * Contact Jenny Escano [mjescano@mail.ubc.ca](mailto:mjescano@mail.ubc.ca) for agar at $21.05 per litre which is enough for 50 plates (may be cheaper options available, didn’t see any on UBC stores)  
* Using autoclaved soil and sterilized seeds, set up each of the 80 treatments in separate plant pots  
  * Literature review suggests 1L pots is a good volume to use for each treatment  
  * 10 seeds per pot  
    * Place the seeds so that they are evenly distributed throughout the pot, 1-2 cm deep in the soil  
  * Fill pot half way with sterilized matrix soil, then add inoculum as a mixture with water (or autoclaved field soil), then cover with more sterile matrix soil   
  * 10% inoculation ratio means we should have about 90mL of inoculum in each soil pot and 900mL (or 0.9L) of sterile matrix soil  
  * Germinate seeds according to ideal germination conditions   
  * Change gloves between handling any non-sterile material to avoid spread of pathogens between samples 

Things we need:

- Plant pots (might have enough already)  
- Seeds (waiting on an estimate from Dave, hopefully free)
- Agar and agar plates ($22)
- Soil ($20 from Canadian Tire)
- Bleach solution ($7 at Canadian Tire)
- Gloves (if we don’t have in lab)  
- Hydrogen peroxide and/or tetrazolium ($5 for H2O2 at Shoppers)

- Total Cost: $55

**Lab protocol: germination monitoring and data collection \- August 23 onwards (10 hours per week)**

* Plant pots that we plan to use are 10 by 10 cm, and the available growth chambers are 75 by 240 cm (assuming I measured the right one)   
  * This gives us space for approximately 160 of these plant pots at maximum fill  
  * Sufficient for the entire experiment, including flexibility for gaps between treatments and extra plant pots for controls or germination success tests  
* After inoculation pots are set up with seeds, soil matrix, and inoculum soils, we will monitor every 3 to 4 days  
  * I propose checking on Tuesday and Friday each week to keep it consistent  
  * Record any new germinants and also note if any previously alive germinants have died  
*
