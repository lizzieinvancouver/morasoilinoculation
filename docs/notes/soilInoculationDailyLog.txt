Soil Inoculation Experiment Daily Log



--------------- August 11, 2025 ---------------
Arrived at stand from which we sampled

- First observation was that it would be difficult to find high density PSME clusters far from any TSHE individuals and vice versa 
- Decided to shift treatments such that far from conspecific for each species group would be dropped and instead we would have a sample from of notably high density of each species (including all of PSME, TSHE, and THPL)
- ie. a soil sample collection from an area of high Douglas fir density, as far from TSHE as possible

- Jonathan mentioned that it may make sense for a future study to check only for the absence of a species and test how seeds germinate in soil microbial communities different from their own

-------------- August 12, 2025 ---------------
Collected soils based on the above discussion
18 degrees, sunny and clear, daily max temp. 30 degrees

Arrived at field site at 7AM
- Soils collected from areas of high species density and low presence of other species (5 bags of soil from each plot, 3 plots per species)
- All bags of the same soil species will be combined, but 5 bags (each one 400mL approximately of soil) were collected from each plot for a total of 15 bags per soil species

Mao, Nolan
Purchased 4 25kg bags of potting soil from Home Depot
Confirmed an experimental design of 15 replicates for each of 12 treatments in addition to 5 replicates of the 25% inoculum treatment

-------------- August 19, 2025 -----------------
Nolan
Met with Jenny Escano from microbio 
Suggested we use TSA agar as it is best suited for all types of pathogens and promoting a fast growth 
Agar ordered from here takes 2 weeks to prepare
Didn’t fit in our timeline, but only $21 for about 50 plates, so could be a good option if the study is run again 

------------- August 21, 2025 -----------------
Mao
Ordered 240 shallow growth trays to germinate the seeds in, as well as 30 big trays to place the smaller pots in for easy manipulation (link:https://indoorfarmer.ca/products/bootstrap-farmer-5x5-microgreen-trays-1-3-tall-no-holes?variant=40598039101505)

-------------- August 22, 2025 ----------------
Nolan
Met with Rolando Descalzo from forestry to learn how to plate agar through sterile methods
Prepared and plated 40 agar plates to be used to test our soils

Dan Buonaito provided advice on a pre-test viability test for our seed. His response is below:
If you are using seeds you purchased from a nursery or seed lot, they
probably already tested the seed and provide a "% purity" measure, which
I think is just a measure of the expected percent viable seeds. If you
can find that, that is probably good enough for a "pre-test"
I am not sure if this works for conifers but some sources recommend a
"float test" where you float seeds in water, and any seeds that sink are
viable (have a filled embryo) and any floaters are bad and shouldn't be
used. Any time I have tried this all my seeds floated, so this
probably only works for certain kinds of seeds.
I focused more on dealing with seeds that didn't germinate by the end
of the studies. For those I did a "crush test" where I gently pressed on
the seeds and for any that ruptured or seemed moldy or goopy or too
light or weird, I didn't include those in my calculations of germination
percentages. I supposed you could also dissect those seeds to check for
embryos.
If you want to be super fancy, I know many seeds labs use
tetrozolium staining to check for viability, but I think you need to
have a bit of a trained eye to interpret the stains :
https://seedlab.oregonstate.edu/sites/seedlab.oregonstate.edu/files/value-tz-test-2004.pdf
There is a chapter in the Baskin and Baskin seeds book about "how to
do a germination experiment". I would say if you roughly follow that and
cite it, your approach is defensible.
TLDR: my guess is that it would be fine to do something very basic
before starting (i.e., rely on reported purity, and if you can't find
that, do a float test or randomly dissect a small number of seeds to
check for embryos). I would definitely evaluate the ungerminated seeds
at the end of the experiment to exclude the ones that aren't viable.

Initial autoclave batch was run on 3 different soil types at 3 different levels in the autoclave
This was done as a preventative measure to ensure autoclave effectiveness

Autoclave settings: 50 minutes at 121º C
Pre-autoclave weights:
355g of PSME soil on the top level of autoclave
333g of TSHE soil on the middle level of autoclave
500g of matrix soil on the bottom level of the autoclave

Soil solutions were also prepared using equal parts autoclaved soil and water to be plated on agar to check for microbial activity

------------- August 28, 2025 -----------------
Mao 
Soil solutions prepared after autoclaving were plated on agar using sterile glass beads and a bio hood, then placed in an incubator to allow microbes to develop

-------------- September 2, 2025 --------------
Mao
Agar plates were checked for microbial activity, but showed no signs of growth 
Indicates that the next autoclave batches are safe to be run

Nolan
Began filling disposable autoclave bags with approx. 700 grams of matrix soil each
Filled around 20 bags today, but was unable to autoclave due to scheduling issues

-------------- September 3, 2025 ---------------
Nolan
Ran 2 batches of the autoclave, containing 12 bags each
50 minutes at 121ºC

Meanwhile, sanitized seeds according to Wenny and Dumroese methods
2:3 ratio of bleach to water with 5% sodium hypochlorite NoName brand laundry bleach
Final sodium hypochlorite concentration was 2%

Seeds were soaked in this solution for 10 minutes with constant gentle agitation to ensure complete sanitation of the seed surfaces
Following this 10 minute soak, seeds were thoroughly rinsed using a strainer and clear tap water a total of 3 times 
The seeds were then soaked in clear tap water for approx. 90 minutes, then rinsed twice more, patted dry with filter paper, then placed in rolled filter papers in the cold room at 5ºC

Mesh bags would be very useful for this step, as they would allow the seeds to be rinsed without the risk of losing any in the sink and so that they don’t need to be transferred between the rinsing container and the strainer

------------- September 4, 2025 ---------------
Nolan
Prepared the final autoclave bags for autoclaving, including bags of homogenized soil collected from TSHE, PSME, and THPL plots
Labelled growth trays with the 18 treatment labels (2 big trays for each of the 12 normal treatments, and only 1 tray for each of the 6 25% inoculum treatments)

-------------- September 5, 2025 --------------
Final autoclave batch was run for 50 minutes at 121ºC

-------------- September 10, 2025 ---------------
Started official cold stratification
Mao, Nolan, Tess

Mixed the soil for different treatment and added about 90 gram of soil in each tray. We sowed 10 seeds in each tray and put them in the growth chambers.
The settings for growth chambers are: 5°C and 60% fan with no light
We also watered the trays and decided to check on them later in the week see how long it takes for them to dry up.

-------------- September 16, 2025 ---------------
Decided on water schedule
Mao

-------------- September 17, 2025 ---------------
Nolan
Watered growth trays with 3L total of deionized water
Distributed evenly over all trays

We decided that the trays need to be watered once a week until the end of the cold stratification.

--------------- September 24, 2025 --------------
Nolan
Trays were watered with 3.5L 

Soils were grouped into the following groups:

10 THPL TSHE

Group 2:

Pots were watered with 3.5L of deionized water

Mao
Tried to cover trays with plastic wrap but perfect seal wasn't possible,
ordered ziplock bags as an alternative


------------- October 14, 2025 ----------------
Nolan 
Trays were placed in large zip lock bags to prevent the spread of soil pathogens between them
Chamber conditions were updated to 20º and 100% PAR for 8 hours each day, and 15º with 0% light for the rest of the day. 

------------ October 16, 2025 ---------------------
Nolan, Tess
Trays were watered with 4L evenly distributed
No germinants yet observed
