Soil Inoculation Experiment Daily Log



--------------- August 11, 2025 ---------------
Arrived at stand from which we sampled

- First observation was that it would be difficult to find high density PSME clusters far from any TSHE individuals and vice versa 
- Decided to shift treatments such that far from conspecific for each species group would be dropped and instead we would have a sample from of notably high density of each species (including all of PSME, TSHE, and THPL)
- ie. a soil sample collection from an area of high Douglas fir density, as far from TSHE as possible

- Jonathan mentioned that it may make sense for a future study to check only for the absence of a species and test how seeds germinate in soil microbial communities different from their own

-------------- August 12, 2025 ---------------
Collected soils based on the above discussion
18 degrees, sunny and clear, daily max temp. 30 degrees

Arrived at field site at 7AM
- Soils collected from areas of high species density and low presence of other species (5 bags of soil from each plot, 3 plots per species)
- All bags of the same soil species will be combined, but 5 bags (each one 400mL approximately of soil) were collected from each plot for a total of 15 bags per soil species

Started official cold stratification
Mao, Nolan, Tess

Mixed the soil for different treatment and added about 90 gram of soil in each tray. We sowed 10 seeds in each tray and put them in the growth chambers.
The settings for growth chambers are: 5Â°C and 60% fan with no light
We also watered the trays and decided to check on them later in the week see how long it takes for them to dry up.

-------------- September 16, 2025 ---------------
Decided on water schedule
Mao

We decided that the trays need to be watered once a week until the end of the cold stratification.
