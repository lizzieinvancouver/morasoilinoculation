Soil Inoculation Experiment Daily Log



--------------- August 11, 2025 ---------------
Arrived at stand from which we sampled

- First observation was that it would be difficult to find high density PSME clusters far from any TSHE individuals and vice versa 
- Decided to shift treatments such that far from conspecific for each species group would be dropped and instead we would have a sample from of notably high density of each species (including all of PSME, TSHE, and THPL)
- ie. a soil sample collection from an area of high Douglas fir density, as far from TSHE as possible

- Jonathan mentioned that it may make sense for a future study to check only for the absence of a species and test how seeds germinate in soil microbial communities different from their own

-------------- August 12, 2024 ---------------
Collected soils based on the above discussion
18 degrees, sunny and clear, daily max temp. 30 degrees

Arrived at field site at 7AM
- Soils collected from areas of high species density and low presence of other species (5 bags of soil from each plot, 3 plots per species)
- All bags of the same soil species will be combined, but 5 bags (each one 400mL approximately of soil) were collected from each plot for a total of 15 bags per soil species
